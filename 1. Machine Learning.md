## Why use F1 Score, not accuracy?

Now if you read a lot of other literature on Precision and Recall, you cannot avoid the other measure, F1 which is a function of Precision and Recall. Looking at Wikipedia, the formula is as follows:

## What is correlation?
At the basic level, a correlation is simply a relationship or connection between two things. When thinking about correlation in the statistical sense, it is a measure of the extent that two variables relate to each other.</br>

## How to we measure correlation?
<b>Technical Explanation:</b><br><br>
“<b>Pearson correlation</b> attempts to draw a <b>line of best fit</b> through the data of two variables, and the Pearson correlation coefficient, r, indicates how far away all these data points are to this line of best fit (i.e., how well the data points fit this new model/line of best fit).”<br>
So the correlation coefficient, r, is the measure of how well your two datasets are related.<br>
The great thing about the correlation coefficient is that it is on a simple scale from 1 to -1. Values near 1 are strongly positively correlated while values near -1 are strongly negatively correlated. Values near zero are not correlated.<br>
A positive correlation means that the values of both variables increase together. A negative correlation means that as the value of one variable increases the values in the second variable decrease.<br>

| '' | Coefficient r | '' |
| --- | --- | --- |
| '' | Positive | Negative |
| `Strong` | 1 - 0.8 | -0.8 to -1 |
| `Moderate` | 0.8 - 0.5 | -0.8 to -1 |
| `Weak` | 0.5 - 0.3 | -0.3 to -0.5 |
| `No Correlation` | 0.3 - 0 | 0 to -0.3 |
