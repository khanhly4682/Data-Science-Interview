1. What is a Z-Score?

- z-score (also called a standard score) gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is. 
- More technically it’s a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is.

z-score = 1 means your data point is 1 standard deviation above the mean.
z-score = 2 means your data point is 2 standard deviations above the mean.
z-score = -1.8 means your data point is -1.8 standard deviations below the mean.

A z-score tells you where the score lies on a normal distribution curve. A z-score of zero tells you the values is exactly average while a score of +3 tells you that the value is much higher than average.

2. How z-score used in real life?
e.g. person’s weight (240 pounds), z-score is 2.0. 
It means that person weight is 2.0 above the average weight. However, you want to know how much above average is this weight?
If you If you look up the score in the z-table, you can tell what percentage of the population is above or below your score. The table below shows a z-score of 2.0 highlighted, showing .9772 (which converts to 97.72%). If you look at the same score (2.0) of the normal distribution curve above, you’ll see it corresponds with 97.72%.
That tells you 97.72% of the population’s scores lie below that particular score and 100% – 97.72% = 2.28% of the scores lie above that score. A mere 2.28 of the population is above this person’s weight….probably a good indication they need to go on a diet!
